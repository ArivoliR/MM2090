# Getting your content right

## Images

  * You can preferably use eps images for latex and jpg images for pdflatex. 
  * If you have some images already to be insered in the latex document, convert them to requisite format using the command "convert" that comes along with the package ImageMagick. You can convert using ImageJ too.
  * If you need to create a schematic, do it using LibreOffice Draw. Don't forget to set the page preferences to A5 size and exporting the file to eps format.
  * An old linux tool called xfig allows for creating vector graphics images and exports them to various formats including eps.

## References

Search engines are not the best to list under references. One is required to list archival resources such as books, journal articles, conference proceedings etc., as references in a technical document. You can locate such articles at some of the sources like the following:

  * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) (Free with not much control on sorting order and full text may need subscription)
  * [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) (Needs subscription)
  * [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) (Needs subscription)
  * [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/) (Needs subscription)
  * [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) (Free and with AI-powered tool)
  * [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) (Free and needs registration)
  * [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (Free archive of pre-prints of scientific literature)

Obtain the bibliographic details of the article you are referring to in bibtex format. You can include those in the bib file and cite the article as demonstrated in the example [here](https://github.com/gphanikumar/MM2090/blob/master/latex).
