# Getting your content right

## Images

You can preferably use eps images for latex and jpg images for pdflatex. 

## References

Search engines are not the best to list under references. One is required to list archival resources such as books, journal articles, conference proceedings etc., as references in a technical document. You can locate such articles at some of the sources like the following:

    * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) (Free with not much control on sorting order and full text may need subscription)
    * [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) (Needs subscription)
    * [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) (Needs subscription)
    * [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/) (Needs subscription)
    * [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) (Free and with AI-powered tool)
    * [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) (Free and needs registration)
    * [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) (Free archive of pre-prints of scientific literature)

Obtain the bibliographic details of the article you are referring to in bibtex format. You can include those in the bib file and cite the article as demonstrated in the example [here](https://github.com/gphanikumar/MM2090/blob/master/latex).
