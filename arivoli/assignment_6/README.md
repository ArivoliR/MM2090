# Assignment 6
## Question 1 - Treasure Hunt (soln not in github)
### Context
Treasure Hunt is back, this time, more fun!! Arceus, the legendary Pokemon, took refuge in
Sinnoh mountains, after its creation, Giratina is caught by the PokeMaster - you.
### Task
- This time, you are tasked in searching for the Arceus - hill by hill, mountain by mountain, and when you spot it, donâ€™t hesitate to throw a Master Ball, and there, you conquer the whole world!!
- You are given a shell binary (script.sh.x). Run it in your home directory. The result will be a cpp file (question 2.cpp), which is committed and branched multiple times, similar to how Arceus has
multiple hideouts and tunnels for escape.
- You can search for Arceus by traversing these branches and nodes. Once you found the Legendary Arceus, immediately merge the commit to the HEAD of the MASTER branch, just as you would
catch Arceus using the Master Ball. The result ? The Pokemon world and hence the treasure hunt is yours.
Note that when you get to the right version of the file, you will see the clear ASCII picture of Arceus,
whereas the rest of them would show its illusions!!

## Question 2 - Image Processing (soln files uploaded above)
You have been given two images, the original Lena as well as a distorted version of her.
### Task
- By taking up kernels for at least two different image operations (such as brightness change, contrast change, gamma correction, motion blur, edge detection, etc.), illustrate how the image is modified.
- Can you reduce the noise in the second image using any of the kernels above? Why does it work / not work?
- Having worked with Fourier Transforms in the previous assignment, can you figure out a way to filter noise from the image by manipulating its values in the frequency domain? How does this perform against the kernel method above? Can you comment on the nature of noise that would be suitable for these various methods?
For the boundary pixels, you can either skip them or consider a periodic boundary condition as you wish. You can also try padding the image.

## Question 3 - Reflection (report has been uploaded above)
### Task
Write a LaTex report which contains your observations and the overall conclusion you got from performing the tasks above.
